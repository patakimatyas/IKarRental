## 🗄️ Data Storage Notice

**This project is for learning purposes only.**  
- All user, car, and reservation data is stored in JSON files (`users.json`, `cars.json`, `reservations.json`).
- **Passwords are stored in plain text**—never do this in a real application!
- No database or encryption is used.

If you want to use this project beyond a classroom demo, **add password hashing and switch to a database!**
